The steps we took to get insights 
           1->clean data with excel by standardizing the column names , limit the birth year of customers because we found years out of range 
           2->importing cleaned data to R
           3->preprocessing data to check if it is valid, reliable, and precise.
           4-> make some transformations like add the field "duration_trip_in_min" to calculate the difference between the start and end of the trip dates.
          5->finally plotted the insights and get conclusions.
